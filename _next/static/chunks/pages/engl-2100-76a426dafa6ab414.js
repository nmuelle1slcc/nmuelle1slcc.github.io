There was no shortage of resources on how to write technical pieces or how to research technical writing, so I am very pleased with the outcome. The thing that stuck with me the most was learning how to write for a specific audience. If I am writing a guide on how to use a piece of software, my guide will look much different if I am writing it for someone who can barely power on a computer and will use only the most basic features as opposed to an expert in that type of software who might be looking for pros/cons between competing programs. In the past, I hadn\u2019t really taken my audience into consideration, which resulted in frustration on both sides if I wrote too far above or below their technical level.
