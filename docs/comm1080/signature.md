# Reflection

The Signature Assignment was a great way to delve deeper into a specific topic from the course. I think reading about negotiation both from the course material and using outside sources helped me to understand and reinforce concepts like principled negotiation, BATNA, and cultural and gendered differences in negotiating. I appreciated how the course emphasized using good negotiation principles like separating people and their positions from the actual issues while emphasizing that people will communicate their positions and needs in a variety of different ways.

I think that most of the concepts taught in this course will be very useful to me in the future, especially in regards to the workplace. Learning how to interpret body language is an invaluable skill that I can use to understand what other people are thinking and feeling and help make them more comfortable around me. Even though I am conflict-averse, I feel like I am more knowledgeable about how to handle conflict appropriately without simply ignoring or conceding on issues. Additionally, I feel like learning about negotiation techniques will be very useful for me moving forward as I have always tried to avoid negotiating on my behalf if I anticipated it would rock the boat or there would be backlash for me.

The other general education courses I've taken haven't touched too much on conflict and diversity, but I took a technical writing class where I learned how to produce writing for a specific audience. I think that this knowledge can help make me a very effective communicator if I ever am in a position where I need to write a document or presentation illustrating how people can incorporate cultural sensitivity or conflict resolution into their workplaces.
