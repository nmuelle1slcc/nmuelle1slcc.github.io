# An In-depth Look into Kpop Album Material Waste and Possible Solutions
Kpop as a music genre has been gaining a strong following in the West over the past decade, and this international popularity has brought some much-needed attention to the underbelly of the Kpop industry: rampant consumerism, overworked artists, slave contracts, and more.

While you could throw a stone and hit several different issues in Kpop that need to be addressed yesterday, I want to focus specifically on album waste, why it happens, why it’s particularly bad in this industry, and what we can do to combat it.

But first, I’d like to delve into the Kpop albums themselves and show what sets this industry apart from pretty much any other major music market in the world: packaging.
Kpop album packaging is another way artists are able to express themselves. With each release, artists and their companies decide on a concept and will design the aesthetic for the physical album, music video, and promotional performances around that concept.

Because of this custom packaging, albums have become valuable collectable merchandise in this day and age of digital streaming. But that’s not the only reason fans are buying.

# Photocard mania
Most Kpop albums will come with one or more random photocards that are part of a set for that album. Because inclusions are random, fans aren’t able to determine which ones they’re receiving prior to opening the album. While the element of surprise can make opening an album feel exciting, it can also lead people to purchase multiple albums if they don’t receive the photocard they wanted. In some extreme cases, fans must purchase multiple albums, sometimes tens or even hundreds of the same album, in order to complete a set of photocards.

Different vendors will also offer additional limited-time benefits for ordering albums, such as posters, special photocards, stickers, and more. A common tactic to increase album sales is to use sales as entry tickets into a fansign lottery where the more albums an individual purchases, the higher chance they will be chosen to be able to participate in an autograph session with the artist.

But why the focus on selling albums when companies could sell these photocards or fansign slots separately? Because increased sales open up new opportunities for artists. With revenue from album sales, artists can pay to appear on promotional music shows where they gain the chance to wow potential fans. High sales can also grant artists invitations to awards shows where they receive massive exposure from a large audience.

# So what’s the solution?
There’s not an easy solution to this problem, but there are a few different options that would help cut down on unnecessary waste:
* Selling photocard packs - This would allow fans to purchase photocards separately and greatly reduce the excess album waste. Companies can even stick with a random model and price photocard packs similarly to albums—we know fans will still pay the price
* Decoupling fansign lotteries from album sales - Fans could still purchase multiple tickets for a chance to attend an autograph session, but this way they won’t be trying to hand out extra albums to their neighbors or grandparents!
* Hybrid digital/physical albums - The last option may be tricky to implement, but the idea is that fans would purchase a digital download and receive album inclusions such as photocards, but not a physical album itself

What do you think? Do companies have a responsibility to try and mitigate the waste from their products? Or should fans simply purchase less and stop collecting photocards and albums?
