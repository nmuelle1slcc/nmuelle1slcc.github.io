# Project 3 Reflection

It took me a long time to decide what to include in the required writing samples for the third project. I'm glad we were able to pick from past assignments because while I wanted to showcase only my best writing, I didn't have the willpower by the end of the semester to begin working on new writing samples. I'm the kind of person who reads over what I wrote five or more times to try and catch errors or anything that doesn't sound right, so even if I didn't make many revisions to my work, I still spent a great amount of time working on this assignment and verifying everything is as good as I can make it.

# Class Reflection

Technical and practical writing have always interested me more than creative writing, so I went into this class with high expectations and intended on absorbing as much information from the course as I could. There was no shortage of resources on how to write technical pieces or how to research technical writing, so I am very pleased with the outcome. The thing that stuck with me the most was learning how to write for a specific audience. If I am writing a guide on how to use a piece of software, my guide will look much different if I am writing it for someone who can barely power on a computer and will use only the most basic features as opposed to an expert in that type of software who might be looking for pros/cons between competing programs. In the past, I hadn't really taken my audience into consideration, which resulted in frustration on both sides if I wrote too far above or below their technical level. I think I have benefited greatly from this course.
