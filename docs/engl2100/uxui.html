        <h1>The Importance of UX/UI</h1>
        <p>We live in a digital age. Software is everywhere: It's in your TV, your phone, the internet, and even your stereo system.
            Software runs the full gamut of design, from the good and the bad to the ugly. Your program can be
            the very best in the world at its specific function, but if it has poor UX/UI, users will dread having to
            interact with it.</p>
        <h2>What is UX? UI??</h2>
        <p><strong>UX</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> are different but connected fields of software design that both focus on the end-user.</p>
        <p>UX stands for <strong>User Experience</strong> and is focused on how the user interacts with the overall system. UX cares
            about when a user should be able to access a form and what happens once they’re done filling it out. UX
            design is largely invisible to the end-user but a user can still tell good design from bad based on how
            software “feels” to interact with.</p>
        <p>A good example of UX is program options: In the past, users had to click a save button after they were
            finished changing settings. Nowadays, many programs will save settings as they’re being adjusted so there’s
            no need to click a separate save button. Because both styles are rather ubiquitous, software needs to give
            clear signaling to the user when settings are saved. This example from Discord uses good UX design that
            informs the user of exactly what is happening and makes it very clear that there are unsaved changes.</p>

        <p>The <strong>User Interface</strong>, or UI, on the other hand, manages how users interact with the software. It cares about
            the presentation of the form, whether there are multiple steps to filling it out, if the main menu is
            visible on that page, and so on. While graphics and style design is a big part of UI, it’s a lot more
            dynamic than just appearance: UI also controls when the user is able to interact with elements and when
            those elements should appear or disappear.</p>
        <p>When talking about elegant UIs, look no further than video games: Part functionality, part art, all game,
            video games truly are a modern marvel. I was
            <a href="https://medium.com/super-jump/top-5-best-video-game-uis-db941d6a9357">researching examples</a> of
            good video game UIs when I ran across this video review for Persona 5’s UI—you heard right, the UI for this
            game is so good that people are creating reviews for the interface itself.</p>

        <p>Whether your software is tracking changes in the stock market, a smart fridge menu, or the next
            greatest thing in gaming, it should be easy to see how combining elements of good UX/UI design will make for
            a satisfying end-user experience.</p>
