# Final Reflection
What connections have you had from what you‚Äôve studied in this LW course with what you‚Äôve learned from other courses you have taken at SLCC or have learned before taking this class? Make specific references to your work in this class and in other courses. How did what you learned in other courses enhance what you learned here, and vice versa?

**Last semester I took a nutrition course where I learned extensively about what nutrients my body requires and what macronutrient ratios I should be eating to fuel my body for different types of exercise. This course builds on that knowledge by showing me how to exercise to build muscle, how to increase my mobility with proper warmups, and how to keep my body flexible by stretching. Prior to this class I have worked out on and off over the course of several years, but the most important thing this class taught me was what my exertion limits are and that I can work out a lot more before becoming exhausted than I previously thought I could.**

Reflect on what you thought about fitness and lifelong wellness before you took this course and how you think about it now that you have completed the course. Have any of your assumptions or understandings changed? Why? What assignments/activities/readings were influential in this process? How will you approach what influenced you differently in the future?

**It has always been difficult for me to work out consistently. Given my choice of activity, I will always gravitate towards video games, spending time online, working on projects, or painting instead of exercise. I know it‚Äôs important to stay active, so I have tried to turn working out into a hobby, but I have found that I have a difficult time sticking with a routine for over a year. I think in taking this course, I‚Äôve realized that I am very motivated by working in a group class and having an instructor tell me to keep going. I‚Äôve been able to push myself far past what I thought my limits were in this course because I keep trying even when I get tired. In the future, I want to enroll in fitness classes to help me keep my activity level up.**

# Signature Assignment
I have decided to reflect on the How To Improve Your Mobility assignment from this semester. While looking back at the assignment, I remembered a story from when I was very first looking at an exercise program in preparation for working out at the gym. The program said to do squats, and at the time I could not squat with my heels flat on the floor. I squatted down with my heels up and was wondering ‚ÄúHow is this supposed to help me? This isn‚Äôt a difficult movement to do.‚Äù I soon realized that my body couldn‚Äôt even complete this simple movement properly, so I spent about a month training my ankle mobility so I could squat properly.

I think sometimes we take our flexibility and mobility for granted and don‚Äôt realize what we were capable of doing until we‚Äôve lost it. Especially as we age, people tend to exercise less and lose mobility, which can be dangerous and lead to things like falls that break or fracture bones.

While exercising is important for our health, I think it‚Äôs just as important to complement physical activity with mobility work for the best long-term outcomes.

## How to Improve Your Mobility
I love mobility exercises. When I was in my late teens and early 20s, I never exercised and had chronic back and hip pain. I became interested in lifting weights and found that every weightlifting program recommends stretching and mobility work. After several months of using mobility exercises to improve my flexibility (I couldn‚Äôt even squat with my feet flat on the floor!), I found that my chronic pain had disappeared.

I was familiar with a few of the movements in the video, like leg swings and threading the needle, but after working alongside the instructor in the video, I can see why he put the program together with those movements. I have okay flexibility but I felt the stretch in every single exercise. After working through this program, it‚Äôs become apparent that I need to improve my shoulder flexibility.
