# Learning Outcomes

### 1. Demonstrate knowledge of human nutritional needs and the role of nutrition in improving individual health and the societal economic impact of food choices.

Nutrition is very closely tied to individual health. There are numerous diseases that people can suffer from due to not getting enough nutrients or eating too many unhealthy foods. For example, a person who is deficient in vitamin C will eventually develop scurvy with symptoms like bleeding gums, bruising and scaly skin, and even tooth loss. A person who eats too much saturated fat will have high levels of LDL (the ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol) in the bloodstream and will be at risk for developing heart disease.

### 2. Relate technological advancements in medicine and food production to the advancement of the science of human nutrition.

Technology and research have made sweeping advancements in both food production and the study of human nutrition. For example, after finding that certain populations are at risk of nutrient deficiencies, we have been able to manufacture fortified foods such as milk with added vitamin D or rice with added vitamin A, iron, folic acid, and other nutrients. We also have been able to synthesize certain nutrients for supplements, which studies show for the most part are just as potent and absorbed just as well as naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.

### 3. Explain the impact that the food industry has on human food choices and the subsequent relationship to health and disease at the individual, societal, and environmental level.

The food industry has had a profound effect on our food choices and, consequently, our health. The industry pushes unhealthy food like snacks and candy because they are very cheap to produce and the combination of sugars, fats, and salts have a high potential for addiction in consumers, making them purchase more and more of these items. This has slowly led to the obesity epidemic much of our world is facing, and in addition to poor health, people are contracting many diseases that are expensive for our health care system to treat.

### 4. Provide examples of past and present nutrient and diet trends in modern society and the positive and/or negative implications on human health and the earth‚Äôs resources.

Diet trends are ever-evolving based on a variety of factors from medical advancements to social media trends that have no scientific support. In the past, low-fat diets were heavily pushed which started a cascading problem of food manufacturers adding salt and sugar to make up for the flavor lost when removing fat. Currently there‚Äôs a popular diet called keto where people will eat so few carbohydrates that their body goes into a metabolic state called ketosis which is where the body will use fat for energy instead of glucose. While the keto diet can be used to lose weight, ketosis can be a dangerous process for people who have type 1 diabetes or suppressed pancreatic function. Many people will start fad diets like this without consulting a doctor to make sure they won‚Äôt hurt their bodies. Trendy diet foods can also have a negative impact on the environment: Quinoa has become popular for its nutritional value, but due to increasing demand and price, the very people who grow this crop can no longer afford to eat it.

### 5. Provide examples of positive and negative interactions of humankind with microorganisms regarding sickness, health and food production.

Our bodies have many different types of relationships with microorganisms, both positive and negative. For example, probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that colonize in our digestive tract and help protect us from harmful bacteria. Bacteria in our gut can even synthesize necessary nutrients like folate and vitamin K. On the other hand, we can also get sick from other types of microorganisms. Botulism is an illness caused by consuming toxins produced by bacteria that largely occurs due to improperly canned or bottled products.

### 6. Address diet and nutrient issues and concerns for weight control, disease prevention, physical activity, food availability, and biotechnology.

When it comes to proper nutrition, food availability plays a large part in weight control and disease prevention. In many developing countries, biotechnology such as breeding hardy or pest-resistant crops or enriching plants with vitamins goes a long way towards helping protect a population against undernutrition. Deficiencies such as vitamin A, zinc, iron, and iodine are especially prevalent in developing countries and deserve a special focus. Likewise, populations in developed countries need to have access to a variety of healthful foods to help promote physical health and support physical activity. These populations are less at risk for health conditions due to undernutrition or malnutrition, but need a special focus on not eating calorie-dense or overly processed foods.

# Nutrition Perspectives

For the Nutrition Perspectives research paper, I opted to watch one of the listed documentaries, and after comparing the summaries for several different films, I decided on That Sugar Film. That Sugar Film is a highly polished and engaging 2014 documentary that details a two-month-long experiment in eating ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù foods with a certain amount of added sugars. It was written and directed by Damon Gameau, an Australian actor, who also stars in the film and is the subject of the experiment. The film explains the biological effects sugar has on the body using high-quality animations and engaging cameos by famous actors such as Hugh Jackman and Stephen Fry. Gameau does not have a professional nutrition background.

I was drawn to a documentary about sugar because of my own history with sugar consumption. When I was younger, soda was my main beverage of choice, and I ate candy and desserts without restraint. My teeth were in bad shape and I rapidly gained weight when I hit puberty. When I entered my 20s, I stopped drinking soda, and began to cut out candy and juices. However, it wasn‚Äôt until I began a workout routine where I was heavily focused on eating the proper amount of macronutrients that I started to seriously look at added sugar in foods and begin opting out of the calories provided by sweeteners so I could eat higher amounts of protein or fat instead.

When the documentary begins, it explains the experiment that Gameau will be undertaking for 60 days: He is to eat 40 teaspoons of added sugar (about 160 grams) a day, consuming not overt junk food such as soda, chocolate, candy, or desserts, but regular food that is normally marketed as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. Since glucose and lactose are naturally occuring sugars present in foods such as dairy and fruit, he won‚Äôt count those sugars towards his goal and will instead be targeting sucrose and fructose for his 160-gram limit. He must pick low-fat options when available, and most importantly, he must maintain the same level of exercise he had prior to the start of the experiment.

Prior to starting the experiment, Gameau‚Äôs daily caloric intake was approximately 2300 calories a day, split into 50% fat, 26% protein, and 24% carbohydrates. He did not consume any refined sugar. His weight was 76 kilograms (167 pounds) and his waist circumference was 84 centimeters. Just 12 days into the experiment, Gameau‚Äôs weight had shot up to 79.3kg (175lbs). A mere 18 days after starting to eat added sugars, Gameau had a blood test done that said he had a large increase in ALT levels in his liver (ALT is an enzyme that helps catalyze chemical reactions). Because these increased levels were found in his bloodwork, it was a sign that cells in his liver were being damaged or dying. The doctor reviewing his blood work said that these are precursor symptoms to fatty liver disease, and he was shocked and impressed that these symptoms could develop over the course of two or three weeks.

During the experiment, Gameau travels to an Aboriginal town to showcase the Westernization of native diets and discuss the insidious effect sugar has on whole cultures. He explains that a foreign grass was introduced to the area and quickly spread throughout the region, affecting people‚Äôs ability to farm and forage for food. There is one grocery store in the area, and for a time this region had the highest per-capita consumption of Coca-Cola in the entire world. For a time, there was a publicly funded education program designed to inform residents of healthy food choices, and in response to the program the local people requested that Coca-Cola no longer be sold in the grocery store. While health improved under this program, the government decided to stop funding it, and the locals‚Äô health once again declined.

After this, Gameau then flies to the United States to speak with various health and nutrition experts. He notes that sugary foods and drinks are even easier to obtain in the States than Australia, and foods that advertise themselves as healthy sometimes have even more sugar added than soda. Halfway into the experiment, Gameau‚Äôs weight has increased to 81.2kg (179lbs) and his waist circumference to 91cm.

During a stop in rural Kentucky, Gameau meets with a local dentist who shares that oral health in the region is heavily suffering, with children as young as five having severe tooth decay, and it being common for teenagers and young adults to have a full mouth of rotted teeth get pulled. The dentist shares that parents will fill baby bottles full of Mountain Dew and most kids can‚Äôt even remember when they started drinking soda. A teenager who is visiting the dentist to extract all of his teeth says that he drinks a 12-pack of soda daily, and his younger cousins are also drinking several bottles per day.

At this point, the audience is introduced to the concept of the ‚Äúbliss point‚Äù. This is a term used in the food industry to describe the optimal amount of sweetness in a product to maximize consumer satisfaction, neither too sweet nor not sweet enough. After this sweet spot was discovered, the first soda released that purportedly hit the bliss point was Dr. Pepper.

The documentary briefly touches on reasons why processed sugar is so insidious, and it suggests that the power and influence of soda companies could have been part of the reason that fat was so heavily demonized while sugar was exonerated. Even today there are studies being done on food and nutrition that are being fully funded by Coca-Cola. While certain scientists decry the act of accepting funding from the very institution whose products you are trying to research as unethical and a conflict of interest, sometimes that‚Äôs the only way research is able to obtain funding.

Sixty days into the experiment, Gameau reveals his final results: His liver ALT levels have gone from 20 below the safety line to 20 above the safety line. His triglycerides have gone from 0.8 to 1.5, which is the risk point. He gained 8.5kg (almost 19lbs) and added 7% body fat. His waist circumference increased by 10cm. Most importantly, during these two months, Gameau‚Äôs caloric intake did not increase, he merely replaced calories that were mostly natural fats with calories from processed sugars.

I think that the theme from this documentary is still very applicable today. Many of us were raised with the message that fat is bad while being exposed to heavy advertising for soda and other sugary foods. Science showing that fats, especially polyunsaturated ones, are healthy and beneficial is slowly being popularized, but I think we also need to emphasize that refined sugars are unhealthy and should be avoided. Gameau‚Äôs original diet in the film was quite a bit different than what is recommended in this course‚Äôs textbook. He was eating 50% fat, 25% protein, and 25% carbohydrates versus the textbook‚Äôs recommendation to eat 20-35% fat, 10-35% protein, and 45-65% carbohydrates. However, his calories were still coming from fresh fruit and vegetables, lean protein, dairy, nuts, and no refined sugar, which are all recommendations that the book does make in regards to food choices. The documentary also discusses the differences between good and bad cholesterol and states that refined food and sugar tends to increase bad cholesterol while healthy fats can increase good cholesterol without contributing to an increase in bad cholesterol, a fact that is shared in the textbook.

The most shocking thing that I learned was that it was possible to lose or gain weight based on the contents of calories consumed and not the calorie number alone. I have followed a CICO (calories in, calories out) mindset for weight gain and loss for a number of years, which states that the number of calories consumed and burned are the only contributing factors to body weight (excluding water weight.) I was also surprised to learn that sugar forms a physical dependency and that by the nature of its short energy boosts it can cause mood swings.

The themes in this documentary reinforced ideas I‚Äôve had about food and sugar for several years, especially the idea that eating naturally occurring fats and sugars is not nearly as dangerous as eating their processed counterparts. I think moving forward I will be extra careful to read food labels and not fall into the trap of eating added sugars in foods that seem otherwise healthy. Knowing about the addictive properties of sugar will also help me to avoid eating patterns that could lead to a future dependency.

# Reflection

### 1. Make connections between what you studied in this nutrition course with what you‚Äôve learned in other courses at SLCC or before.
##### Make specific references to your work in this class and in the other courses.
##### How did what you learn in the other courses enhance what you learned in nutrition, and vice versa?

Prior to taking this Nutrition course at SLCC, I spent some time studying nutrition because I was trying to gain muscle at the gym, and I learned that the types of food you eat can have a big effect on body composition and muscle growth. I learned a little about recommended daily macronutrient balance during this time, and I had also learned about vitamins and minerals in school as a child, but this course went into a lot more detail about the chemical makeup of these nutrients and how they function inside our bodies. It was especially enlightening learning about how nutrients such as calcium can inhibit the body‚Äôs ability to absorb iron, or about how electrolytes such as sodium and potassium help move water in and out of cells.

### 2. Reflect on how you thought about nutrition before you took this course and how you think about it now that the course is over.
##### Have any of your assumptions or understandings changed?
##### Why?
##### What assignments/activities/readings were influential in this process?
##### How will you approach (course topic) differently in the future?

Before taking this course I had a rough knowledge of good nutrition, things like eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, avoiding heavily processed foods, eating ‚Äúgood‚Äù fats instead of ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones, getting enough protein for building muscles, but I didn‚Äôt understand the why behind any of it. I really enjoyed learning the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats, learning why saturated fats are solid at room temperature while unsaturated fats aren‚Äôt, and learning the chemical structure of trans fats and why they can be so damaging in the body. I also was under the assumption that sugar should be avoided at all costs, but I learned that carbohydrates are all made up of sugars and that our body requires these sugars for fuel. It‚Äôs sugar that is added to food for sweetness like high fructose corn syrup that should be avoided. When we had to complete the assignment about new laws concerning food labels and were shown that companies need to list added sugar separately, that‚Äôs when the concepts we had learned about in class really started making sense to me in a real-world application. I admit I also was scared when learning about health conditions that can result due to poor nutrition, so in the future when I ‚Äúfall off the wagon‚Äù with eating healthy, I know I will have additional motivation to return to healthful eating patterns.
