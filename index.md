SLCC Student ePortfolio  
Natalie Mueller

# Introduction
My name is Natalie and I am a returning student. I am working towards a Computer Science degree and enjoy software development and design, especially UX/UI. My hobbies include video editing using ffmpeg CLI, arguing with Discord bots when they do what I told them to do (but not what I wanted them to do), watching Kpop music videos, hyperfixating on various interests to gain immense but unnecessary knowledge, and using oxford commas.

My dream in life is to run a small business and help people.
